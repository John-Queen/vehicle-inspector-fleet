# Vehicle Inspector - Fleet Management Application

## Overview

Vehicle Inspector is a comprehensive fleet management application designed specifically for managing trucks, trailers, and rigid vehicles. The application provides a modern, interactive interface for conducting detailed vehicle inspections using 3D models, which offers significant improvements over traditional paper/photographic logs.

## Key Features

### 1. Fleet Management Dashboard
- Overview of the entire fleet (trucks, trailers, rigids)
- Inspection status tracking (pending, completed)
- Damage reports summary
- Fleet operational status monitoring
- Recent activity feed

### 2. 3D Vehicle Inspection
- Interactive 3D models for different vehicle types (DAF, Volvo, Mercedes, MAN, etc.)
- Accurate 3D representation (99% match to actual vehicles)
- Visual damage marking on 3D models
- Damage severity classification (minor, moderate, critical)
- Comprehensive damage reporting

### 3. Voice-Enabled Note Taking
- Speech-to-text for hands-free note input
- Text-to-speech for note playback
- Voice recognition for efficient documentation

### 4. Customizable Inspection Checklists
- Vehicle-specific inspection categories

- Exterior, Interior, Mechanical, and Compliance sections
- Dynamic checklist management

### 5. Vehicle Management
- Comprehensive vehicle database
- Detailed vehicle specifications
- Inspection history tracking
- Maintenance scheduling
- Status monitoring (operational, maintenance, out of service)

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React.js for UI components
- Three.js for 3D modeling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Web Speech API for voice features

### Backend (Planned)
- Node.js/Express.js API
- MongoDB for data storage
- Authentication and authorization
- Real-time updates

## Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**: 3D modeling provides more accurate damage documentation
2. **Better Communication**: Easy sharing with workshops and insurers
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Quick access to vehicle status and history
4. **Reduced Disputes**: Clear visual evidence of vehicle condition
5. **Accessibility**: Voice features for hands-free operation

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time tracking integration
- Maintenance scheduling and reminders
- Cost analysis and reporting
- Driver performance monitoring
- Mobile application for field inspections
- Integration with telematics systems
